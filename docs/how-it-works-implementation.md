**Last Modified Summary:** Initial implementation of comprehensive How It Works page

## Overview

The How It Works page (`/how-it-works`) provides a comprehensive explanation of the repair bonus system for both customers and repair shops. The page is designed to be easily understandable and digestible for both user groups.

## Features

### Dual Audience Design
- **Tab-based navigation** between customer and shop information
- **Clear visual separation** with different colored sections
- **Role-specific content** tailored to each audience's needs

### Customer Journey (5 Steps)
1. **Find Repair** - Search for suitable repair shops
2. **Generate Bonus** - Create personal repair bonus code (CHF 100, 30-day validity)
3. **Visit Shop** - Bring item and required documents to chosen shop
4. **Repair & Payment** - Pay reduced amount (repair cost minus CHF 100)
5. **Background Processing** - Automatic settlement between shop and city

### Shop Process (4 Steps)
1. **Registration & Qualification** - Open-house contract system with quality assurance
2. **Customer Service & Verification** - Bonus code validation and repair process
3. **Documentation & Upload** - Digital capture of repair details and documents
4. **Monthly Settlement** - Automatic payment from city (ERZ)

### Additional Sections
- **Benefits overview** for partner workshops
- **FAQ section** with common questions for both audiences
- **Contact information** for further inquiries
- **Call-to-action buttons** linking to relevant pages
