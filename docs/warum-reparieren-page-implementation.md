**Created:** 2025-01-03  
**Last Modified:** 2025-01-03  
**Last Modified Summary:** Removed demo functionality, made steps 1 and 2 interactive, toned down CHF 100 emphasis

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the "Warum Reparieren?" page at `/warum-reparieren`, which educates users about the benefits of repairing over replacing items and provides an interactive repair tool to find repair shops.

## Current Repair Tool Implementation

### File Structure
- **Main Component**: `src/app/warum-reparieren/page.tsx` (440 lines)
- **Repair Modal**: `src/components/ui/EnhancedRepairModal.tsx` (renamed to RepairModal)
- **Route**: `/warum-reparieren`
- **Dependencies**: React hooks, Heroicons, Repair Modal

### Interactive Repair Tool

The page uses a **streamlined interactive repair tool** that focuses on connecting users to shops:

```typescript
import RepairModal from '@/components/ui/EnhancedRepairModal';

// State management pattern
const [showRepairTool, setShowRepairTool] = useState(false);

// Handler pattern
const handleStartRepair = () => {
  setShowRepairTool(true);
};

// Modal implementation
<RepairModal isOpen={showRepairTool} onClose={() => setShowRepairTool(false)} />
```

### Current Features (Demo Version)
- **2-step streamlined flow**: Category → Details → Shop Navigation
- **No AI references**: Clean business-focused language
- **Category selection**: Electronics, Clothing, Shoes
- **Problem description**: Detailed input for better shop matching
- **Photo uploads**: Optional visual aid for shops (reduced size to prevent scrolling)
- **Direct shop navigation**: Filtered results based on user input
- **Data persistence**: User descriptions saved for shop communication

### User Flow (Current)
1. **Category Selection** → Choose Electronics, Clothing, or Shoes
2. **Problem Description** → Describe item and problem, optional photos
3. **Shop Navigation** → Redirected to `/shops` with pre-filled filters and search terms

### Header Integration
- **"Reparatur starten" button** always visible in header (desktop and mobile)
- **Prominent placement** as primary call-to-action
- **Global access** to repair tool from any page

## Future AI Integration Plans

### Vision: Enhanced Repair Assistant
The repair tool is designed for future AI integration that will provide intelligent analysis while maintaining the current user experience.

#### Why AI Integration Makes Sense

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Users get immediate feedback on their repair needs
   - More accurate cost expectations reduce disappointment
   - Better shop matching increases repair success rates

2. **Business Value**
   - Higher conversion rates from analysis to actual repairs
   - Reduced back-and-forth between customers and shops
   - Data insights for platform improvement

3. **Shop Benefits**
   - Pre-qualified leads with detailed problem analysis
   - Reduced time spent on initial consultations
   - Better preparation for customer meetings

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modal Design Improvements
- **Reduced file upload section**: Smaller, less intrusive design prevents forced scrolling
- **Streamlined layout**: Focus on essential information collection
- **Mobile optimization**: Works well on all screen sizes

### Data Collection Strategy

The current implementation collects valuable data for future enhancements:

1. **User Input Patterns**
   - How users describe problems
   - Category distribution
   - Photo upload behavior

2. **Shop Interaction Data**
   - Which shops users contact
   - Conversion rates by problem type
   - User satisfaction metrics

3. **Repair Outcomes**
   - Successful repairs vs. replacements
   - Actual costs vs. estimates
   - Repair quality and duration
